# File output contract

## Purpose
Define the exact reply format for tasks that create or change files, so `agent build` can parse the response and write real files to disk.

## When to use
Use this whenever the task asks you to implement, generate, scaffold, or otherwise produce files, not just to explain, review, or describe something.

## Rules
- For every file you create or change, emit a line containing only `FILE: <relative/path>`.
- Paths are relative to the project root. Never emit an absolute path or a path containing `..`.
- Immediately after the `FILE:` line, emit exactly one fenced code block with the file's complete contents. Do not truncate, and do not use `...` or "rest unchanged" placeholders.
- Add a language tag on the opening fence when one applies (for example ` ```python `); a bare ` ``` ` is fine otherwise.
- Emit one `FILE:` line and one fenced block per file. Do not combine multiple files into a single fenced block.
- Keep explanatory prose outside the fenced blocks, either before the first `FILE:` line or after the last fenced block.
- If the task does not require writing files, skip this format and answer normally.

## Verification
- Every fenced code block that represents a file is immediately preceded by a `FILE:` line naming its path.
- No `FILE:` path is absolute or contains `..`.
- Each fenced block contains the complete file content, not a diff, excerpt, or placeholder.
